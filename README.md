This repo includes data and activities to support SI 676,
the networked services course in Fall 2025.

# Course Description

This course provides information professionals with skills to thrive in a networked 
environment. Technical material in the course will be presented in a context that 
emphasizes its relevance to information professionals. A central theme is programmatic 
access to open source systems, allowing information institutions to build services 
beyond their walls. The full course syllabus can be located at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gB5DKamJ38Tt_hfXkIC_lHYeia_Gb_IEqrMP3t7ilPQ/edit?usp=sharing>. 

# Learning Goals

These activities were designed with the intents to:

* Gain confidence in using a non-graphical computer interface (i.e., a text-based command interface to work with local files and those on a remote server);
* Understand how to use web-based services to share metadata (i.e., APIs, OAI-PMH);
* Learn about, explain, and gain confidence in using common data encodings for library/archive/museum (LAM) metadata, including JSON and XML;
* Develop a conceptual understanding of linked data concepts and how they are (or can be) applied in a digital collection environment;
* Conceptualize and design metadata transformations, implement using computational tools (i.e., APIs, Python scripts, and OpenRefine) to extract, transform (crosswalk), and ingest metadata for digital library objects;
* Create and implement a metadata application profile for a digital collection;
* Find and use resources for keeping up with rapid developments, standards, and new tools or concepts for managing the networked environment and LAM metadata space.

# Structure of the Repository

There are a few specific folders:

- `in-class-notes` contains notebooks or other files that document demonstration sor activities understaken in class
- `collection-site-materials` contains resources that may be useful for working on the course collection site activities

## Sources

Some of these lessons are based on previous iterations of
my digital curation courses, 
including iterations in 2018, 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024.
